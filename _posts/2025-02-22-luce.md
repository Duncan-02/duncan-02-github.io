Right now it works but it is still very tedious and limited to 100 a month. It still is an improvement since I can just send an email from any device and ir gets sorted automatically but there should be a way to make it even better. Right now I still have to go into google docs, open document, copy, paste into terminal for each post. Ideally the document should have multiple posts, so that I only have to do this once in a while.
Also I could make it so that the whole post is alrady made and I only have to commit it to the website, this could be a lot harder.
